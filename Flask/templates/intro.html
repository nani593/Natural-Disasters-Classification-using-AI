    <h1><center>China, India and the United States are among the countries of the world most affected by natural disasters. <br>
    Natural disasters have the potential to wreck and even end the lives of those people, <br>who stand in their way. However, whether or not you are likely to be <br>affected by a natural disaster greatly depends on where in the world you live, The objective of <br>the project is to human build a web application to detect the type of disaster. The input <br>is taken from the in built web cam, which in turn is given to the pre trained model. <br>The model predicts the type of disaster and displayed on UI.
